	<p>This is part two of the series of the three meals I had on a trip to Manhattan. Right after my Malaysian lunch, my friends and I wanted dessert. We stayed within Chinatown and checked out 10 Below, a small store that specializes in rolled ice cream. The rolled ice cream making process is unique and interesting. A milk or cream base is poured on a chilled surface and spread thinly so that it can freeze quickly. Other ingredients, in this case strawberries, are chopped and mixed in. Then, the ice cream is scraped off, rolled into shape, and topped off with treats. For my Strawberry Shawty order, I included bananas, blueberries, Teddy Grahams, and a toasted marshmallow.</p>

	<p>On such a hot summer day, this dessert treat hit the spot and helped my friends and me to cool down significantly. Plus, it was delicious. The freshness of the fruit and the various textures from the melting ice cream to the crunchy Teddy Grahams really helped the individual ingredients to come together. The whole treat was greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
	<p>It is also very affordable and they only come in one size. It is $7 including tax. There is usually a long line at the store in the already busy Chinatown, so you should expect to wait a while. However, I definitely recommend this rolled ice cream treat.</p>
