	<p>Today, I had lunch at Habit Burger in Fair Lawn, NJ. I've been to a Habit Burger in a different location once before, and I enjoyed the food so much that I invited my friend to come along. I decided to go with my previous order: a Charbuger with fries and fountain drink. The burger comes with mayonnaise, pickles, tomato, lettuce, caramelized onions, toasted bun, and slightly-charred beef patty (hence its name). The total order comes to around $8 (tax included), so it's very affordable. My friend had the same.</p>
