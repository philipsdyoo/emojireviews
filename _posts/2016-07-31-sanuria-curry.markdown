	<p>This will be the first part of a series of three meals I had on a trip to Manhattan, NY with two of my friends. We went to catch Pokemon in Central Park and visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art to which one of my friends has never been. The weather was unbearable; it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and very humid.</p>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/post-img/2016-07-31-sanuria-curry-img2.jpg" alt="Roti Canai">
	<p>We started the day in Chinatown. My friend suggested a Malaysian restaurant which he visited many times before. It was underground in a basement hidden away from view. Without prior knowledge, it would be difficult to locate this restaurant. We started the lunch with roti canai, which is sort of flatbread that is eaten by dipping in a bowl of curry. It was crispy yet pliable and spongy enough to soak up the flavorful curry. It was a great appetizer dish, and I highly recommend roti canai.</p>
	<p>The main course is a curry beef served with rice. The dish did not include curry itself, so I poured the roti canai curry over my rice. The flavors were not very strong nor impressive. It was nothing to write home about. It was a fairly mediocre dish. However, it was very low priced: around $6 for the dish. It is a very affordable lunch, and for its price, this level of quality is expected. The music the restaurant played was also unfitting for a Malaysian restaurant in the heart of Chinatown; they played songs from Mama Mia. All in all, I enjoyed the roti canai more than the curry beef entree.</p>
