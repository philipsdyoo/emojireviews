	<p>Today, I had lunch at Habit Burger in Fair Lawn, NJ. I've been to a Habit Burger in a different location once before, and I enjoyed the food so much that I invited my friend to come along. I decided to go with my previous order: a Charbuger with fries and fountain drink. The burger comes with mayonnaise, pickles, tomato, lettuce, caramelized onions, cheese, toasted bun, and slightly-charred beef patty (hence its name). The total order came to around $8 with tax included, so it's very affordable. My friend had the same.</p>
	<p>While we waited for our orders, the pager buzzed indicating it was time to pick up our delicious meal. Unfortunately, a different customer mistook our burgers for his and took them to his table before we arrived to the counter. The manager apologized and told us that he would remake our burgers. This was no problem since this would allow my friend and me to further catch up and converse. We thanked him and went back to our table. A few minutes later, our orders were brought to the table.</p>
	<p>It was simply delicious. It had all the ingredients a burger should have with the slight charred flavor you get from grilling a patty over coals or charcoal. The fries were crispy but weren't out of this world. But then again, the burger is the star of the meal. There's also a pepper bar where you can pick up pepperoncini, sliced or whole, to accompany your meal. Before I knew it, the burger was gone even though I tried to savor each bite.</p>
	<p>Later, an employee, apologizing for the mistake, came over with a coupon (pictured below) for a free Charburger. I was totally fine with the hiccup and it wasn't the restaurant's fault. However, this level of customer service and the quality of the food convinced me to return to Habit Burger once more with an empty stomach.</p>
