	<p>Last week, I visited Kun Jip (큰집 translated as "Big House") in Palisades Park, NJ with some coworkers for lunch. We walked around searching for virtual creatures on the recently released app Pokemon Go on that scorching hot and humid day. However, instead of going for a nice cool salad and ice cold lemonade to stave off the heat, I decided to eat the incredibly hot and spicy budae jjigae (부대찌개 translated as "army stew").</p>
	<p>Budae jjigae is a dish that was created back in the days of the Korean War when people did not have many ingredients to whip up a filling meal. The Koreans used what they had at the time to create this spicy stew with Spam and hot dogs for protein and kimchi, a Korean staple. You can learn more about budae jjigae <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budae_jjigae">here</a>. As to why this specific choice for my meal in this sweltering heat: it's simply because Koreans believe one must combat heat with more heat.</p>
	<p>The bubbling budae jjigae arrives to the table while my coworkers ordered bibimbap, another popular Korean dish. The budae jjigae contains a spicy broth, kimchi, Spam, hot dogs, tofu, and ramen noodles topped off with some mushrooms. All this comes in a medium-sized pot with a small bowl of rice and a variety of side dishes. I couldn't wait to dig in even though I risked scalding my mouth from the high temperature of the broth. It was a bit spicy, but the hunks of pork (Spam and hot dogs) and tofu make a great addition to the overall taste and to help lessen the spiciness. Plus the ramen noodles add bulk to the dish, making this an incredibly delicious and filling meal. This lunch was a great and satisfying one, and it only made me crave budae jjigae even more. I'm getting hungry as I write this review.</p>
