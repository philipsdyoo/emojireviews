<p>Emoji Reviews is my personal blog for reviewing all kinds of products and services, primarily food, in an interesting way. With the use of emoji becoming more and more commonplace, I decided to experiment and challenge myself by communicating to the audience with only emoji. It's proven to be quite difficult, but I include a text version of the review at the bottom of each post.</p>
